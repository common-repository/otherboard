== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plugin without an Otherboard account? =

No, an Otherboard account *is* required to use this plugin. You can sign up with a free 14-day trial at otherboard.com.

= How is support handled? =

We take our help desk roles seriously. Paying customers will have access to a private Facebook group for additional support — where we will be hosting regular office hours. You will also have built in help in your browser for private help tickets via Intercom.

= What do you do with my data? Is it safe? =

We will never utilize your data in any way other than to serve your dashboard. All of the information we gather for your site is firewalled off from us, no employee will ever see it and we never share it with anyone else. Ever. Plus, if you have additional team members on your account, you can control how much of your sensitive data they can see—so your VA can’t get access to your revenue/ranking/rpm numbers if you don’t want them to see.

Securing your data is our top priority. We know your data is sensitive and want to you rest assured every part of Otherboard was created with security in mind. Please refer to [our Security page](https://otherboard.com/security) for more details.

Absolutely. We have [a public roadmap](https://otherboard.canny.io/) where you can vote or give feedback about features you'd like to see and upvote/downvote and comment on upcoming features based on your needs.

= Do I need to use something like Zapier to use Otherboard? =
